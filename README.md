# Apollo ReactJS PoC

Apollo ReactJS PoC is Front end application which consume GraphQL based server. Its sends GraphQL Queries to retrive data and uses GraphQL mutations to create objects on server side.

 Here is brief introduction to functionality it offers.

1. Allow user to Create RiskTypes which is defining new Entity in system and attributes associated with that Entity. 
2. Frontend makes use of GraphQL mutation and nested input types to create new RiskType (Entity on server).
3. Allow user to Create Risk Instances based on RiskType which is like creating and saving objects of chosen type.
4. User can browse RiskTypes and Risk. 
5. View Single Risk screen let user to select Risk name from Autocomplete dropdown box. Upon selection user fetches details of single  Risk Instance.
6. View All Risk screen lets user to paginate through list of Risk instances of chosen type in both direction (forward and backward). This achieved using cursor based pagination on server side. GraphQL only support forward only cursor by default. Backward navigation is enabled by implementing stack in Redux Store.

# It makes use of following technology.
- ReactJS, Element React component library, Redmond theme from jQuery UI, FontAwesome, TypeScript, lint.
- Redux for global state store, Redux-thunk middleware.
- Axios library to communicate with server, uses token authentication.
